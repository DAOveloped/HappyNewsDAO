# Happy News DAO Project

This project aims to create a decentralized news platform, Happy News DAO, where journalists can submit and publish news articles while ensuring authenticity, sentiment analysis, and proper payment processing. The project is divided into multiple modules, each responsible for specific functionalities. This ReadMe file provides an overview of the modules and their interfaces/APIs for smooth integration.

## Modules Overview

### Module A: Signing up new journalists
- Description: Handles the process of onboarding new journalists and improving the application process.
- Interfaces/APIs:
  - User registration: Allows journalists to sign up by providing necessary information and credentials.
  - Application process: Provides a folder-based system to guide journalists through the application process.
  - User storage: Stores journalist information securely.

### Module B: Article Scanning and Verification
- Description: Scans and verifies the authenticity of new articles submitted by journalists, along with sentiment analysis.
- Interfaces/APIs:
  - Article submission: Receives new articles from journalists.
  - Article scanning: Performs checks to ensure the articles are not AI-generated and verifies human authenticity.
  - Sentiment analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of the articles.
  - Storage: Stores the scanned and analyzed articles securely.

### Module C: Payments and Journalist Payouts
- Description: Handles payment processing received from Twitter and facilitates payments to journalists.
- Interfaces/APIs:
  - Payment receipt: Receives payments from Twitter.
  - Payment processing: Calculates appropriate payments for journalists.
  - Journalist payout: Manages the payout process to ensure timely and accurate payments.
  - Folder organization: Utilizes appropriate folders for managing payment records.

### Module D: Twitter Account and Article Integration
- Description: Handles the management of the Twitter account and integration with the HappyNewsDAO platform.
- Interfaces/APIs:
  - Article submission from Twitter: Receives new articles posted on the Twitter account.
  - Integration with HappyNewsDAO: Ensures seamless integration of new articles into the HappyNewsDAO platform.
  - Monitoring and synchronization: Monitors the Twitter account for new articles and synchronizes them with the platform.

### Module E: Core Logic and Sentiment Analysis
- Description: Handles the core logic of the entire project, including sentiment analysis and secrecy of sensitive information.
- Interfaces/APIs:
  - Sentiment analysis integration: Integrates with Module B to perform sentiment analysis on articles.
  - Core logic: Implements the overall logic for the project, coordinating various modules and functionalities.
  - Secrecy and security: Ensures the protection of sensitive information and maintains the secrecy of the decentralized application.

## Dependencies and Integration
- The modules interact with each other through well-defined interfaces/APIs.
- Dependencies between modules should be managed through appropriate versioning and referencing mechanisms.
- Each module should be developed independently, allowing for modular updates and maintenance.
