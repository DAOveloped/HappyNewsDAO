## HappyNewsDAO Project Checklist

### Module A: Signing up new journalists
- [ ] Create a folder structure for the application process
- [ ] Develop a smart contract to handle journalist registration
- [ ] Integrate the [Deform](https://deformapp.cc) application form with the smart contract
- [ ] Store journalist information securely (consider encryption)
- [ ] Implement a process for improving the application process based on user feedback
- [ ] Set up [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets) to store form submission information

### Module B: Article verification and sentiment analysis
- [ ] Research and select an appropriate AI tool for article verification
- [ ] Integrate the selected AI tool into the dApp for article scanning and authenticity verification
- [ ] Implement sentiment analysis using [Sentiment Analysis Tools](tool-link-here) to rate the sentiment of submitted articles
- [ ] Explore decentralized storage options (such as [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io)) for storing verified articles securely

### Module C: Payments and journalist compensation
- [ ] Design a payment system for receiving payments from Twitter
- [ ] Develop a mechanism to calculate payments based on article clicks
- [ ] Create a smart contract for managing payments and compensating journalists
- [ ] Implement secure and decentralized payment transfer methods using [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation)
- [ ] Utilize [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com) to query historical pay for journalists
- [ ] Set up a database (e.g., [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets)) to store payment data securely

### Module D: Twitter account management
- [ ] Set up a dedicated Twitter account for HappyNewsDAO
- [ ] Implement functionality to handle new articles submitted to HappyNewsDAO
- [ ] Develop a process to automatically publish articles to the Twitter account
- [ ] Integrate with the article verification module to ensure only authentic articles are published

### Module E: dApp core logic and self-improvement features
- [ ] Design and implement the core logic of the dApp
- [ ] Develop an AI API integration for self-improvement features
- [ ] Implement sentiment analysis and other operational processes
- [ ] Store and update self-improvement features using appropriate decentralized storage solutions

### Smart contract development
- [ ] Identify the required functionalities for each module and define smart contract interfaces
- [ ] Write smart contracts in a suitable programming language (e.g., Solidity)
- [ ] Test and debug smart contracts to ensure accuracy and security
- [ ] Deploy smart contracts to an appropriate blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum)

### GitHub repository setup
- [ ] Create a new repository on GitHub for the HappyNewsDAO project
- [ ] Initialize the repository with a suitable project structure
- [ ] Commit and push the initial codebase, including smart contracts and dApp implementation
- [ ] Continuously update and maintain the repository with new features and bug fixes

### Continuous autonomous operation
- [ ] Implement monitoring and error handling mechanisms for the dApp
- [ ] Set up automated testing processes to ensure ongoing functionality
- [ ] Consider implementing decentralized governance mechanisms for DAO decision-making
- [ ] Regularly review and update the project to adapt to evolving technologies and requirements
