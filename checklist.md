- [x] Embed the journalist application form in the Happy News DAO Twitter account
- [x] Implement functionality to automatically store journalist submissions to Google Sheets (using Deform or similar tool)
- [x] Set up the necessary credentials and authentication for accessing the Google Sheets API
- [x] Develop a script or tool to receive a trigger when a new application is submitted
- [ ] Create a function to retrieve the latest application from the Google Sheet named "Applications" and the tab named "Applications"
- [ ] Integrate with Module E (Node.js API) to send the new application for sentiment analysis
- [ ] Implement a mechanism to receive the sentiment analysis results from Module E (Node.js API)
- [ ] Store the sentiment analysis results next to the original application in Google Sheets
- [ ] Send the application results (including sentiment analysis) to the applicant's Twitter account
- [ ] Ensure proper data privacy and security measures are in place when handling journalist information
- [ ] Handle errors and edge cases in the application submission and retrieval process
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring to track the application submission and processing flow
- [ ] Test the end-to-end flow of application submission, sentiment analysis, and result handling
- [ ] Document the entire process, including setup instructions and any necessary configurations
- [ ] Review and optimize the performance and efficiency of the application submission and processing flow


### Module B: Article verification and sentiment analysis
- [ ] Research and select an appropriate AI tool for article verification
- [ ] Integrate the selected AI tool into the dApp for article scanning and authenticity verification
- [ ] Implement sentiment analysis using [Sentiment Analysis Tools](tool-link-here) to rate the sentiment of submitted articles
- [ ] Explore decentralized storage options (such as [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io)) for storing verified articles securely

### Module C: Payments and journalist compensation
- [ ] Design a payment system for receiving payments from Twitter
- [ ] Develop a mechanism to calculate payments based on article clicks
- [ ] Create a smart contract for managing payments and compensating journalists
- [ ] Implement secure and decentralized payment transfer methods using [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation)
- [ ] Utilize [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com) to query historical pay for journalists
- [ ] Set up a database (e.g., [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets)) to store payment data securely

### Module D: Twitter account management
- [x] Set up a dedicated Twitter account for HappyNewsDAO
- [x] Implement functionality to handle new articles submitted to HappyNewsDAO
- [ ] Develop a process to automatically publish articles to the Twitter account
- [ ] Integrate with the article verification module to ensure only authentic articles are published

### Module E: dApp core logic and self-improvement features
- [ ] Design and implement the core logic of the dApp
- [ ] Develop an AI API integration for self-improvement features
- [ ] Implement sentiment analysis using Langchain for article sentiment analysis
- [ ] Store and update self-improvement features using appropriate decentralized storage solutions

### Smart contract development
- [ ] Identify the required functionalities for each module and define smart contract interfaces
- [ ] Write smart contracts in a suitable programming language (e.g., Vyper)
- [ ] Test and debug smart contracts to ensure accuracy and security
- [ ] Deploy smart contracts to an Fantom network 

### GitHub repository setup
- [x] Create a new repository on GitHub for the HappyNewsDAO project
- [x] Initialize the repository with a suitable project structure
- [ ] Commit and push the initial codebase, including smart contracts and dApp implementation
- [ ] Continuously update and maintain the repository with new features and bug fixes

### Continuous autonomous operation
- [ ] Implement monitoring and error handling mechanisms for the dApp
- [ ] Set up automated testing processes to ensure ongoing functionality
- [ ] Consider implementing decentralized governance mechanisms for DAO decision-making
- [ ] Regularly review and update the project to adapt to evolving technologies and requirements
