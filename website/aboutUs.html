        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Happy News DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) 
          focused on delivering fresh news from fresh voices. 
          Our mission is to provide a platform for independent journalists and 
          citizen reporters to share their motivating, empowering, and informative stories with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that everyone should have a voice, and that the best way to achieve this is 
          through decentralized technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency. By using these tools, 
          we can create a platform that is truly open and transparent, where anyone can 
          contribute to the news cycle.
        </p>
        <p>Our layers of decentralization are outlined below, though we are a DAO 
            because our operations are conducted without human intervention and operate autonomously, 
            aside from writing the articles of course. We can also be referred to as a decentralized 
            application, or dApp, because we are built on top of <a href="https://fantom.foundation/" alt="fantom">Fantom</a> and
            will eventually be accessible on your phone like an application.
            Our layers of decentralization is outlined below from a high level, but we will go into more detail in the dApp Stack 
            section. 
        </p>
        <p>Here is our "Journalist Journey" outlined from the original application all the way to receiving their pay:</p>

            <h3>Layer 1: New Journalist Application</h3>
            <p>A future journalist can apply <a href="https://t.co/DywtDuSMs2">here</a> with their name or pseudonym, fantom wallet address, 
                and a short sample (less than 1000 words) of their writing that is either motivating, empowering, or informative. </p>
                <p>The smart contracts that operate this layer will be located in Module A of our <a href="https://github.com/HappyNewsDAO/HappyNewsDAO">github</a></p>

        <!-- Layer 2 -->
        <div class="box-container">
          <div class="box">
            <h3>Layer 2: Application Screener</h3>
            <p>This is an automated process that reviews applications for factors ranging from 
                human authenticity, writing quality, content originality and relevance. After review, an automated decision is sent to 
            to the applicant welcoming them aboard or requesting a new sample writing.
            </p>
            <p>The smart contracts that operate this layer will be located in Module B of our <a href="https://github.com/HappyNewsDAO/HappyNewsDAO">github</a></p>

        <div class="box-container">
          <div class="box">
            <h3>Layer 3: Fresh Article Screener</h3>
            <p>A newly accepted journalist can submit their article along with 1-10 pictures in the link at the top right of this page.
                At this point, an automated process will screen the article for human authenticity, original content, and relevance and then either accept the article and send to layer 4 or message 
                the author requesting them to submit again. </p>
            <p>The smart contracts that operate this layer will be located in Module C of our <a href="https://github.com/HappyNewsDAO/HappyNewsDAO">github</a></p>

        <div class="box-container">
            <div class="box">
            <h3>Layer 4: Publish and Store Your Article</h3>
            <p>Once an article is accepted from a journalist, it will be stored permanently on the blockchain through Filecoin and will be simultaneously published to twitter
                and on our website. This will be an automated process by a smart contract that will be triggered by the article being accepted by the Fresh Article Screener.

            <p>The smart contracts that operate this layer will be located in Module D of our <a href="https://github.com/HappyNewsDAO/HappyNewsDAO">github</a></p>

                <div class="box">
                <h3>Layer 5: Financial Payments</h3>
                <p>As your articles are read on twitter, we get paid per click and pay you 90% of that every hour on Fantom. Because of the instant finality, high security, and cost efficiency, you
                    have the opportunity of being paid hourly for your work. Because of smart contracts and their abundance of utility, this is an automated process requiring no human interaction. </p>
                <p>The smart contracts that operate this layer will be located in Module E of our <a href="https://github.com/HappyNewsDAO/HappyNewsDAO">github</a></p>

              <div class="box">
              <h3>Layer 6: App Logic & Self-Maintenance</h3>
              <p>This module contains the private smart contracts that make sure the app stays up and running considering the risks of every layer above and every tool listed in the dApp Stack page, whether they are intentional or unintentional attack vectors.
               </p>
              <p>The smart contracts that operate this layer will be located in a separate private github repository.</p>
